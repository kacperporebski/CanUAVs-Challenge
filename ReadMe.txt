Program was created on visual studio 2019, with  references to Micosoft.VisualBasic and System.Web.Extensions.
File paths are passed through as command line variables.
When prompted for output path, enter only the path not the file name.
Examples : X:\     
	   C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop
The file generated at that path will be called output.txt
